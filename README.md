# To keep you in the loop...

I've just finalized and tested the ability to find matches. It's good enough for now, it requires a fair-sized fuzzy match. 

I also added the "network" model , but haven't tested it. It represents a collection of interesting articles centered on the same question (e.g, distance perception in VR; biometrics)

Next steps I see is testing the network idea, and giving the ability to add in Google Scholar references (cited_by) so that the search can go forward in time too.
